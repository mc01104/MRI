= Starting protocol simulation.
  - The protocol contains 1 event blocks.
  - These event blocks do supply DSP instructions for approximately 0.000000.

= Gradient amplitude check is active:
  - Maximum allowed gradient strength in X orientation: 43.000000 mT/m
  - Maximum allowed gradient strength in Y orientation: 43.000000 mT/m
  - Maximum allowed gradient strength in Z orientation: 43.000000 mT/m

= Gradient slew rate check is active:
  - Maximum allowed slew rate in X orientation: 180.180176 mT/m/ms
  - Maximum allowed slew rate in Y orientation: 180.180176 mT/m/ms
  - Maximum allowed slew rate in Z orientation: 180.180176 mT/m/ms

= Sequence passed the gradient amplitude check successfully.
  - The maximum allowed gradient strength has not been exceeded.
  - The peak gradient strength in X orientation was: 23.979834 mT/m.
  - The peak gradient strength in Y orientation was: 0.000000 mT/m.
  - The peak gradient strength in Z orientation was: 23.979834 mT/m.

= Sequence passed the gradient slew rate check successfully.
  - The maximum allowed gradient slew rate has not been exceeded.
  - The peak slew rate in X orientation was: 171.284521 mT/m/ms.
  - The peak slew rate in Y orientation was: 0.000000 mT/m/ms.
  - The peak slew rate in Z orientation was: 171.284521 mT/m/ms.

= Simulation successfully complete
